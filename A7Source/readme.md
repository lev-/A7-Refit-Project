Contents
--------
PSD files for the diffuse and normal maps for the A7 Boy Body, as well as a clean, Ken-doll style mesh for easier armor modding.

Instructions
------------
These files require Adobe Photoshop to use. GIMP may or may not be able to process the contents of these files, I don't know. Either way, I'm not interested in teaching anybody how to use Photoshop. That said, here are some general instructions for using these PSDs.

Layers are sorted into groups, and color coded for easier identification.

If the layer is red, leave it alone unless you're sure you know what you're doing, or you just feel like playing around (and possibly messing something up).

If the layer is green, do whatever you want with it. The green layers include groups for dirt and grunge, tattoos, scars, and blemishes. Dig around and see what you can find, and feel free to add on however you like. The scars and moles have corresponding layers in the normal maps, and if you enable both you can create some pretty neat effects.

If you feel like the skin looks too 'glittery' in the game, you can fix this by going to the layer group called 'Alpha' in each normal map, and disabling the 'More Noise' layer. Then merge the group (you might want to duplicate the group first, for backup) and copy the results into the Alpha channel. Don't forget to hide the 'Alpha' layer before you export (I've done that a couple times... it's not pretty).

If you add anything to the hands, you'll want to make sure you make a copy for the first person texture (handmale_1st.dds).

Anyway, that's it, in a nutshell. Have fun.
